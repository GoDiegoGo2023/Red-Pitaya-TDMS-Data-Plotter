# Red Pitaya TDMS Data Plotter
## Program Purpose
This program reads .tdms files (National Instruments file format) and plots the data that is recorded with the Red Pitaya Stream Server application.
The user has the option to display graphs together or separately, as well as save the images to the computer.
## Specifications/Limits
The Red Pitaya has 2 fast analog inputs from which data can be recorded. Prior to recording the data, the user can specify if input 1, input 2, or both inputs are to be used for data acquisition. This means that a maximum of two graphs will be output. The program only works if the data is a .tdms file format; **no other file types are currently supported**.
